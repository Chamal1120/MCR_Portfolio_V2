# My Portfolio website --V2

<img src="images/portfolio%20v2%20img.jpg" alt="portfolio IMG">

This is my second attempt at making a portfolio website from scratch with HTML and CSS3.

This one uses HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6 as the programming languages.
Key things I focused on while making this site are,

* @media selector from CSS3 to make my site responsive to various display sizes
* Variables usage from CSS3 for ease the usage of font attributes.
* My initial Javascript experience using JS ES6.
* To polish my Git commands skills.
